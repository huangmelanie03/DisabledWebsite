        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        My name is Melanie Huang and I was extremely motivated to create this site in order to inform others about people who are important but also always neglected. Those who are disabled should have an opportunity to show their true potentials without anything holding them back. 
        I am an officer of a club called RESPONSE and our main goal is to respond to/help aid young children in Nagaland, India with building an education as well as expensive medical costs. Through this club, I realized how difficult it is to live as a disabled regardless of if you live in a developed or developing country.  
        I personally believe that the problem lies in our education system. Not enough people are knowledgable about certain topics which means they do not have a true understanding of the issues prominent today.

        I hope that in the future, more voices in the world are HEARD and through spreading important messages around, we can understand how neglected people feel.
        The disabled should not feel as if they are below ANYONE.
