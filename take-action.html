          Previously, those with disabilities had to fight by protesting in front of buses in order to gain wheelchair lifts. Although they are still like any other person, there is a great difference in the treatment they receive. 
Make a change and educate others in your communities about the importance of equal treatment within all people. Encourage others to be in support of the disabled world.</p>
